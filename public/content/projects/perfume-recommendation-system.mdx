## Overview

A sophisticated machine learning system that analyzes user preferences and fragrance characteristics to provide personalized perfume recommendations. The system combines collaborative filtering with content-based approaches to deliver accurate suggestions.

## Key Features

- **Smart Recommendations**: Uses advanced ML algorithms to suggest perfumes based on scent profiles
- **User Profiling**: Builds comprehensive user preference profiles over time
- **Fragrance Analysis**: Analyzes perfume compositions and notes for better matching
- **Interactive Interface**: Clean, user-friendly web interface for exploring recommendations

## Technologies Used

- **Machine Learning**: Python, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Backend**: Flask/FastAPI
- **Database**: PostgreSQL

## Challenges & Solutions

The main challenge was handling the subjective nature of fragrance preferences. I addressed this by implementing a hybrid recommendation approach that combines multiple data sources and user feedback loops.

## Results

- Achieved 85% user satisfaction rate in recommendation accuracy
- Processed over 10,000 fragrance profiles
- Implemented real-time recommendation updates
