## Overview

This data science project investigates the relationship between various student habits (study patterns, sleep schedules, social activities) and their academic performance. Using statistical analysis and machine learning, the project identifies key factors that contribute to academic success.

## Key Features

- **Comprehensive Data Analysis**: Statistical analysis of student behavior patterns
- **Predictive Modeling**: ML models to predict academic performance based on habits
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Dynamic charts and graphs showing correlations
- **Research Insights**: Actionable findings for educational institutions

## Technologies Used

- **Data Analysis**: Python, Pandas, NumPy
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, XGBoost
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- **Statistical Tools**: SciPy, Statsmodels
- **Notebooks**: Jupyter Notebook

## Key Findings

- Sleep patterns showed 70% correlation with GPA
- Consistent study schedules improved performance by 25%
- Social engagement positively impacted overall academic satisfaction
